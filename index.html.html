            The lives, loves, dangers and disasters in the town, Mystic Falls, Virginia. Creatures of unspeakable horror lurk beneath this town as a teenage girl is suddenly torn between two vampire brothers.
            After centuries of quarreling, Stefan and Damon Salvatore return to their original town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. Stefan, the selfless, brave, guilt-ridden brother, meets a high school girl named Elena Gilbert whom he instantly falls in love with ;while Damon, the gorgeous, dangerous and selfish vampire, is after his brother's girl to pay him back for making him turn into a vampire in 1864.
            145 years after they are turned into vampires during a vampire hunt, Stefan and Damon Salvatore return home, a small town called Mystic Falls. Stefan returns to meet Elena Gilbert who has an uncanny resemblance to his (and his brother's) old love, Katherine Pierce. Damon returns to follow his brother and give him the eternal misery he promised him; they soon discover the war is not over.
            Vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon Salvatore, battle for the affection of selfless teenager, Elena Gilbert. Stefan is the good and kind-hearted brother that feeds on animal blood to keep from killing anybody, and Damon is the selfish and dangerous older brother that feeds on human blood carelessly. Elena is brought into the supernatural world that she was hidden from as a girl and surrounds herself with a circle of human AND supernatrual friends, ready to fight the hunters and enemies that wait for them in the shadows.
            As Elena, a doppelganger sharing a striking resemblance to Katherine Pierce (the love interest of Salvatore brothers Stefan and Damon), suffers from the death of her parents, she starts to think that she will never be happy again. Soon after, a hot new student shows up, Stefan Salvatore, and they fall instantly in love despite her knowing nothing about his past. Stefan's older brother Damon shows up to keep good on his promise to ensure him an eternity of misery and ends up falling in love with Elena, too. On her birthday, Damon gives Elena back a necklace she cherishes, and that's the moment she realizes she loves him. Towards season 4, she and Stefan break up and she spends the next few seasons with Damon. He makes her happy and able to believe in herself. He challenges her to become her best self, and subsequently oblivious and distracting her from the dangers that lurk beyond. Lucky for her, certain powers of her own are beginning to wake, which have been subdued since childhood, as well as having a circle of friends with gifts of their own to protect her.

            Damon Salvatore is a vampire, turned by Katherine Pierce 145 years prior to the series' debut. He is the son of late Giuseppe Salvatore, ripper Lily Salvatore and older brother of Stefan Salvatore. Damon is portrayed as charming but cruel, taking pleasure in killing and feeding on humans, while Stefan satisfies his vampiric hunger by feeding on animals.
            Grew up… in a turbulent, uncertain time. Damon was born on June 28, 1839, in Mystic Falls, Virginia. As a child, he was extremely close with his younger brother, Stefan. The two lost their mother while they were young. And unfortunately, their father subsequently heavily favored Stefan over Damon, believing that Damon was irresponsible and disobedient.

            Living… with never-ending anger. Damon came of age just as the Civil War began, and he was forced to enlist in the Confederate army. While on leave, he met a vampire named Katherine Pierce. Head over heels in love with her, Damon wanted Katherine to turn him so that the two could spend eternity together. Katherine was also seeing Stefan, and gave her blood to both of them so that they would become vampires. Infuriated that Katherine also turned Stefan, Damon promised his brother “an eternity of misery.” 

Profession… none. Unlike Stefan who poses as a high school student, Damon is not one to deal with pretensions. More often than not, Damon can be found at the local diner, the Mystic Grill. He drinks there daily and observes the local population. When it strikes his fancy, Damon causes havoc in people's life for his own personal pleasure.

Interests… love, revenge, dancing, leather jackets, and Bourbon.

Relationship Status…  single. Damon has never gotten over Katherine. Even though she ultimately chose Stefan over him, he has spent his entire vampire life pining after her. She disappeared from both brothers' lives years before, but unbeknownst to Stefan, Damon knows that Katherine is still trapped in the church the Founding Fathers of Mystic Falls entombed her in. Damon has returned to free her - so that they can finally spend eternity together.

Challenge… obtaining closure. Damon's greatest challenge is forgiving his brother and letting go of Katherine. For almost two centuries, Damon has staunchly believed that Stefan's actions inadvertently led to Katherine's capture and subsequent imprisonment. His anger not only hurts others, but also himself. Damon is prone to self-destructive behavior - and if he cannot find it in himself to forgive others, he will end up alone for eternity. However, regardless of all the pain he causes Stefan, Damon loves his brother and actively protects him from harm.

Personality… arrogant, loyal, pragmatic, manipulative, cruel, and volatile. Damon always seems to have an ulterior motive. He completely disregards human life, and does not have any moral qualms about using those around him as living, breathing blood bags. He honestly says, "You know, I used to miss being human. Now I can't think of anything more miserable on earth."

            Elena Gilbert is at the heart and soul of The Vampire Diaries series by New York Times best-selling author L. J. Smith. The novels follow her romances and dramas with the Salvatore brothers, Damon and Stefan. Both are vampires who were turned centuries earlier and find their way to Elena's hometown of Fells Church, VA.

Elena meets and falls for Stefan, who is kindhearted and striving to live a moral life as best he can, given that he must drink blood to stay alive. But it's not long before Damon, the sexy older brother with a dark edge and no interest in being good, arrives in town, wreaking havoc and even pulling at Elena's heartstrings. At first, Elena is unaware of a startling fact and significant force in all the complicated attraction ahead: She is doppelgänger of the vampire who turned the Salvatore brothers nearly 500 years earlier—Katherine von Swartzchild. As the series unfolds, Elena finds herself being pulled between the two brothers as she struggles to find her place in the human and supernatural worlds.

                Originally, when she was human, Caroline was kind, caring and loyal to her friends. However, she was also shown to be rather selfish and self centred while having a lot of insecurities regarding herself. Caroline also has a bit of a sometimes difficult friendship with Elena. Caroline is jealous of Elena, believing she will always live in her shadow, causing her to become competitive, trying to out shine Elena. Caroline was also insensitive as she never considered other people's feelings when they were going through a difficult time in their own lives.

However, Caroline began to change once she became a vampire. Although Caroline had difficulty in the beginning when she became a vampire, she has since learned to control herself, displaying incredible skills of self control for her hungar of blood. She becomes much more confidant in herself as well as becoming more independent, strong, protective and responsible. Caroline has also become a better person, more kind, caring and considerate and is more sensitive to delicate matters. However, Caroline whether as a vampire or human, displays a judgemental side and can be biased as she strongly disapproves of Elena falling in love with Damon and instead encourages Elena to be with Stefan instead. Due to this, it causes Caroline to not consider others feelings again and instead tries to make everyone see the worst in a particular person. However, she eventually comes to overcome this, realizing her faults and wrongs and later comes to accept Elena and Damon's love for each other. Overall, Caroline is happier as a vampire, seeing she has now become a better person.

            Untriggered Werewolf
While he was still an untriggered werewolf, Klaus had a complicated life. He was close with his half-sister Rebekah, whom he affectionately called "Bekah", and with his half-brothers Elijah and Henrik. He also had a close relationship with his half-brother, Kol, but he did not get along at all with his half-brother Finn, since childhood.

However, he had a bad relationship with his overbearing stepfather Mikael who was harder on him than any of his siblings. He was a victim of his stepfather's physical and verbal abuse since childhood. Klaus even admitted to Rebekah that Mikael frightened him which made him constantly seek his approval without ever finding it.

His mother Esther often tried to calm Mikael when he became angry with Klaus, but she never tried to stop him from humiliating or from physically/mentally abusing her son. Also as an untriggered werewolf, Klaus had the aggressive behavior of one, but he could not act on it due to his mother making him wear a magical necklace, created to weaken his strength and thus leaving him vulnerable to Mikael's abuse.

These following reasons led him to resent both his parents and possibly to be jealous of his maternal half-siblings for having their approval.

In the director's cut of the backdoor pilot of The Originals, Elijah pointed out that as an untriggered werewolf, Klaus was so full of love and life, and that all he ever wanted was to be loved in return, especially by his stepfather.

                Stefan Salvatore was one of the two main male protagonists of The Vampire Diaries. Stefan was a 171-year-old cured vampire and the distant descendant and doppelgänger of Silas. Stefan was born and raised in the supernatural town of Mystic Falls, Virginia and came of age during the time of the Civil War. Stefan was the youngest child of Giuseppe Salvatore and Lillian Salvatore. He had an older brother, Damon Salvatore, who is also a cured vampire and whom he shared a strained relationship with, stemming from the appearance of Katherine Pierce over whom they fought whilst human.

During the years following his transition, despite the help from close friend Lexi Branson, Stefan has constantly battled with his bloodlust, and during the 1900s after "falling off the wagon" due to Damon's unhealthy influence, he widely became known as the Ripper of Monterey due to his inability to control his blood thirst. For a brief time, Stefan was romantically involved with the Original, Rebekah Mikaelson, and shared a close friendship with her brother, Niklaus.

After many years away, Stefan returned to his hometown of Mystic Falls to visit his distant nephew, Zach. Stefan then saw Elena Gilbert for the first time while rescuing her after her parents' car drove off Wickery Bridge. After finding her personal records and observing her from afar, Stefan determined that Elena was definitely not Katherine. Still, he was strongly intrigued by her and decided to pose as a new transfer student at Mystic Falls High School to get to know her. They were instantly drawn to each other and they immediately bond, beginning a romantic relationship shortly afterwards. However, despite them becoming romantically involved, various and numerous obstacles begin to come between the two, making Stefan and Elena struggle and fight to be together. They grow distance after Elena's transition, and later break up, due to Elena's heightened feelings for Damon. He later discovered that this is due to the creation of a sire bond between Elena and Damon after Elena's transition to a vampire. He then embarked on a journey to Nova Scotia with Elena, Shane, Damon, Bonnie, Jeremy, and Rebekah to seek the the cure that can help break the sire bond.

At the end of the fourth season, Stefan ends up heartbroken when the sire bond is broken and Elena still decided to choose Damon over him. Stefan decides to leave town and start over elsewhere. However, Stefan ends up being confronted by Silas, finally revealing his true form and locks him in a safe underwater.

                Elijah Mikaelson (Elder Futhark: ᛖᛚᛇᚨᚺ ᛗᛁᚲᚨᛖᛚᛋᛟᚾ) was the deuteragonist of The Originals. He was formerly a major recurring character in The Vampire Diaries, serving initially as an antagonist in the second season and eventually becoming a supporting character and protagonist in the third season and fourth seasons. Elijah was an Original Vampire.

Elijah was the third child and second son of Mikael and Esther. He was the younger brother of Freya and Finn, and the older brother of Kol, Rebekah and Henrik and the older half-brother of Klaus. He is also the uncle of Freya and Mathias' unborn son, Klaus and Hayley's daughter, Hope, and Freya and Keelin's son, Nik.

Throughout his long life, Elijah had several romantic relationships. In the early 11th century, Elijah and Klaus were both in love with a Petrova Doppelgänger named Tatia. Elijah accidentally killed Tatia after he became a vampire and was traumatized and horrified by the violence of his actions towards her. Elijah's mother, told him to seal the event behind a "red door" and to clean himself up. As long as he was clean, nothing of what happened behind the red door could hurt him. As such, this became Elijah's defense mechanism to cope with the horrors of his vampirism for the next thousand years.

In the 15th century, Elijah was romantically involved with another Petrova Doppelgänger, a young girl from Bulgaria, named Katerina Petrova. In the 19th century, Elijah was romantically involved with a witch named Celeste Dubois, whose death was later caused by his half-brother Klaus. In the 21st century, Elijah rekindled his relationship with Katerina Petrova aka Katherine Pierce, before ending it to go to New Orleans to help Klaus. In New Orleans, Elijah developed feelings for Hayley Marshall, who was carrying Klaus' child, after he had promised to protect her and the child. Elijah respectfully kept his distance while she was married to Jackson Kenner.
